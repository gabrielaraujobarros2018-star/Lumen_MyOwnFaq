# did i Lost my versions?

Here's how i keep my phone storage data intact: Ever thought a version is lost? i Find it in my storage and i upload it if Found.
- Upload to github, MEGA or Both
- But having the storage (HDD, SSD, eMMC, or UFS) intact is important for that
- Old ZIPs are often archived in my storage for future Lost-but-found moments

Lost-but-Found?? Yes, that's the term i use for that. Like saying it's lost forever but finding obscure old versions in /downloads, /dcim, or other folders.

Below here, Just wanna warn you: **There's no sensitive data in these photos**. These are just my Lost-but-found moments.
